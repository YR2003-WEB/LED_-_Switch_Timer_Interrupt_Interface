# LED_-_Switch_Timer_Interrupt_Interface
This project demonstrates Timer0 interrupt handling using the LPC2129 (ARM7) microcontroller, programmed in Embedded C with Keil µVision IDE. One LED is toggled periodically using a Timer0 interrupt service routine (ISR) configured through the VIC, while another LED is controlled using a push button (polling method). The program highlights the use of hardware timers, interrupt configuration, GPIO manipulation, and real-time event handling in ARM7-based embedded systems.
